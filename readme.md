BaiPiaoOCR means a PiaoLiang( A Chinese word  means Beautiful in English ) OCR Engine From Baidu, it's based on PaddleOCR & OnnxRuntime.

Note： The project is derived from https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR

We create the project to transfer PaddleOCR's model into the version of Onnx model to deploy the model on almost every devices, such as x86 PC, Android & IOS.

We are using Paddle2ONNX (https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle2ONNX)  to transform it to Onnx format.
